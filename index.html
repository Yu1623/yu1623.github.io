        I am a senior from Mountainside <a href="#ai_imaging"> High School </a> in Beaverton, Oregon. I love playing Virtual Reality games. As a passionate game developer, I hope to one day create VR games of my own. I am interested in Computer Science, particularly Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality. Beside VR games, I love music and read a lot of science fiction novels.

        <b>Neural Video Synthesis for Safer Coronary Angiography Imaging</b>
    <br>Coronary angiography imaging is a technology that captures images of a patient’s blood vessels. It starts by inserting a long flexible tube called a catheter – injected with a contrast agent (dye) – into the patient’s blood vein. The contrast agent is released into the heart’s blood vessels, allowing an X-ray machine to quickly take images and provide views of the blood vessels. Surgeons often use this medical imaging technology to observe the conditions and locations of a patient’s blood vessels during some heart-related surgeries. In order to show the area of interest consistently in video form, blood vessel videos have to be taken at a high frame rate, which exposes both the patient and surgeons to large doses of potentially harmful X-ray radiation. 
    <br>
    <br>In this project, I aim to develop a safe coronary angiography imaging technology that reduces the frequency of X-ray exposures. Specifically, I employ an advanced AI technology, neural video frame synthesis, to generate a high-frame-rate angiography video from a raw video captured at a low frequency. In this way, my technology reduces the frequency of X-rays and X-rays exposures to the surgeons and the patient but still provides a high-quality and smooth coronary angiography video to assist them when conducting surgery.
