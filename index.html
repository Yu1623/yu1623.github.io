        I am a senior from Mountainside High School in Beaverton, Oregon. I love playing Virtual Reality games. As a passionate game developer, I hope to one day create VR games of my own. I am interested in Computer Science, particularly Artificial Intelligence and VR. Beside games, I love music and read a lot of science fiction novels.

    <b>Abstract</b>
    <br>Coronary angiography imaging is a technology that captures images of a patient&apos;s blood vessels. It starts by inserting a long flexible tube called a catheter &ndash; injected with a contrast agent (dye) &ndash; into the patient&apos;s blood vein. The contrast agent is released into the heart&apos;s blood vessels, allowing an X-ray machine to quickly take images and provide views of the blood vessels. Surgeons often use this medical imaging technology to observe the conditions and locations of a patient&apos;s blood vessels during some heart-related surgeries. In order to show the area of interest consistently in video form, blood vessel videos have to be taken at a high frame rate, which exposes both the patient and surgeons to large doses of potentially harmful X-ray radiation. 
    <br>
    <br>In this project, I aim to develop a safe coronary angiography imaging technology that reduces the frequency of X-ray exposures. Specifically, I employ an advanced AI technology, neural video frame synthesis, to generate a high-frame-rate angiography video from a raw video captured at a low frequency. In this way, my technology reduces the frequency of X-rays and X-rays exposures to the surgeons and the patient but still provides a high-quality and smooth coronary angiography video to assist them when conducting surgery.

    <b>Abstract</b>
    <br>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly powerful for a wide variety of tasks. One common use case is when a user asks a question in terms of a text prompt, an LLM generates text as an answer. Despite the exciting potential of LLMs in serving society's needs, it has already been discovered that they can be exploited for malicious applications. In this work, I study <em>prompt injection</em>, a technique used by a hacker to embed malicious inputs into a text prompt to escape the security measure of an LLM system and make the LLM leak sensitive data or spread misinformation. I develop, <em>AutoGuard</em>, an automatic security system to safeguard LLMs from such prompt injection attacks. The core of <em>AutoGuard</em> is its Guard node that detects malign prompts. I implement the Guard node with one of four detection approaches: anomaly detection with few-shot learning, anomaly detection with zero-shot learning, signature detection with few-shot learning, and signature detection with zero-shot learning. These detection algorithms are powered by Google Gemini 1.5 Pro. My experiments show that my system is promising in securing LLMs from prompt injection attacks.

      <br>
      Internship with Dr. Ignacio de La Higuera at Portland State University 
      <br>Organized by Institute for Computing in Research, 2023 Summer
      <br>
    <b>Abstract</b>
    <br> For a long time, scientists had believed that viruses could only contain RNA or DNA but never both. However, the discovery of the crucivirus, a type of virus possessing the characteristics of a circular rep-encoding single-stranded DNA virus and a capsid gene similar to the capsid gene of RNA tombusvirus, challenged the prevailing paradigm of viral evolution. <em>What is the relationship between the crucivirus and viruses that only have DNA or RNA?</em> In this project, we investigate the evolution of the crucivirus as well as its relations with DNA and RNA viruses through four alignment-free analyses: genome sense prediction, pairwise comparison, k-mer similarity between CP and Rep genes, and comparison of k-mer between genomes. Genome sense prediction helped identify genomes that had recently undergone horizontal genetic transfer. Pairwise comparison revealed distinct evolutionary processes for the CP and Rep genes of the same crucivirus genome and discovered two genomes, <em>Cruci_CruV_319</em> and <em>Cruci_CruV_320</em>, that may have recently diverged from their closest common ancestor. K-mer similarity between CP and Rep genes helped us compare the similarity between CP and Rep of crucivirus, DNA virus, and RNA virus. Finally, comparisons of k-mer between genomes, specifically between DNA virus and crucivirus, showed possible locations of horizontal genetic transfer between DNA virus and crucivirus.
