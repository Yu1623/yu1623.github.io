     I am a senior in Mountainside High School in Beaverton, Oregon. 
     I play a lot of virtual reality games. I am a passionate game developer. I am interested in computer science, particularly artifical intelligence and virtual reality. 
     Besides VR games, I love music and read a lot of sci-fi books.

    <b>Neural Video Synthesis for Safer Coronary Angiography Imaging</b>     <br><br>
    Coronary angiography imaging is a technology that captures images of a patient’s blood vessels. It starts by inserting a long flexible tube called a catheter – injected with a contrast agent (dye) – into the patient’s blood vein. The contrast agent is released into the heart’s blood vessels, allowing an X-ray machine to quickly take images and provide views of the blood vessels. Surgeons often use this medical imaging technology to observe the conditions and locations of a patient’s blood vessels during some heart-related surgeries. In order to show the area of interest consistently in video form, blood vessel videos have to be taken at a high frame rate, which exposes both the patient and surgeons to large doses of potentially harmful X-ray radiation. 

In this project, I aim to develop a safe coronary angiography imaging technology that reduces the frequency of X-ray exposures. Specifically, I employ an advanced AI technology, neural video frame synthesis, to generate a high-frame-rate angiography video from a raw video captured at a low frequency. In this way, my technology reduces the frequency of X-rays and X-rays exposures to the surgeons and the patient but still provides a high-quality and smooth coronary angiography video to assist them when conducting surgery.
